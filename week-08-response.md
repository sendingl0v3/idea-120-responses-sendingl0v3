When using the internet and consuming media, I'm heavily targeted for predatory ads. This especially is amplified due to being a part of many minority groups. As someone with ADHD, I often get ads for medication that can be delivered through mail. I often get targeted ads for things I have recently searched up on google and other times I get ads of things I talk about with friends, which can be scary. I think the internet could be more useful and egalitarian without these methods. Targeted ads can sometimes be useful, when advertising apps or methods that make it easier for those who might not have the ability to do certain things these apps are made for on their own. Even though they can be considered useful, I still believe they are heavily harmful and predatory. There is always a catch, and oftentimes you eventually have to pay money to use the most useful tools on these apps. These ads are designed to reel you in just enough to accept the bait and bite. They are oftentimes not made just to help people but just to monetize it and profit from the people who use them. If users on the internet wanted to find certain products or apps then they would search for them or even just become familiar with them through word of mouth. This idea of ads and targeting people is just a tool to further push the capitalist system we are under.
