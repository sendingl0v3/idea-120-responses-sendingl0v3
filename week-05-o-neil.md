  According to O’Neil, a WMD, short for Weapons of Math Destruction, are systems or models (usually harmful) created to evaluate large numbers of people. O’Neil talks about how privileged, often more wealthy people, are excluded or not really affected by them. WMDs are made for minority groups, those who aren't deemed worthy enough by creators of these harmful systems. WMDs are often incredibly discriminatory.
  WMDs can look like many things and are prevalent in today's society. For example, applications for housing are WMDs. Credit is definitely a WMD. These applications ask for many things, such as credit scores, salary, history of being a felon, etc. Like many other WMDs, this one is also incredibly discriminatory. These questions are used to make it harder for those who aren't wealthy to obtain housing. Many people don't make twice or even three times the rent (required for some housing ) to obtain housing, especially with the minimum wage status. In other situations, there could be a lack of credit history, making it impossible to meet the credit score most landlords require. Some people who grew up in poor circumstances have their credit ruined before they are even adults. I was one of those people, my parent would put my name on bills and not pay them or pay them late, which negatively affected my credit. This made it incredibly hard for me to get an apartment. In Illinois there are no laws that prevent landlords from refusing to rent to felons. All of these things are used against those attempting to find stable housing.
