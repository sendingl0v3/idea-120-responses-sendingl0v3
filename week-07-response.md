I agree with Bridle and the problems he lays out in his essay. The content on youtube that is targeted towards kids can get very weird very fast and is definitely alarming. I don't think young kids should be able to get on youtube unsupervised. I am not a fan of censorship but when it comes to videos and audiences like this, I think it is only necessary. I can only see these videos being harmful to impressionable kids and think it is a good idea for kids to be supervised on youtube and especially the internet. I would also hope that their time on youtube is limited. Youtube has some pretty messed up videos, some mild examples can be found in Bridles essay. As Bridle insinuated, there are far worse videos on youtube that can come across a kids screen. These videos are very concerning and exploitative. It is probably best if parents try not to get their kids to watch Youtube all together or only watch it when they are with their child.
