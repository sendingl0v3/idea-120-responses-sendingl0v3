I do believe some of Murrays predictions about inhabiting virtual environments were successful. Murray mentions allowing viewers to make choices in movies, this has been done with the movie Bandersnatch on Netflix. I also believe that covid and qurantining may have some effect on whether people are more into digital worlds that show more detail on the movie or show they are watching. Because of quarantine, people become more invested in media due to all the free time they have. This causes more interest in the media they are consuming. This could also mean the complete opposite, though. People might not have the energy to think outside of what is provided by the show or movie they are watching due to dealing with the stressors of everyday life, especially during a pandemic. Murrays prediction is not far off from the hyper realistic virtual environments of the actors of ‘The Mandalorian’. Their environment on set is hyper realistic due to the LED screens they use instead of green screens. These LED screens allow for a smoother filming and more realistic look. This makes it easier as a viewer to get into the world of The Mandalorian.
