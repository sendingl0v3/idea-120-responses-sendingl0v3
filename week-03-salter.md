### Week 3 Response
  The term Gesamtkunstwerk, talked about by Wagner, translates closest to ‘the total work of art’. This is talked about in a way where there are multiple art mediums used in a project, study, or overall design. This goes to say that multiple types of art can intersect with one another throughout an overall art piece.
  Today, gesamtkunstwerk shows up a lot in architecture. It’s present in movements like bauhaus, de stijl, and art nouveau. Along with architecture, it is also prevalent in things like film art, audiovisual arts, and new media art. These art forms use a combination of things like music, image, theater,etc.
